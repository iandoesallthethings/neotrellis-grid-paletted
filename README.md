# neotrellis-grid-paletted
Teensy code from okyeron modified with gradient color palettes.  Boots up with all 8 available palettes showing - push a button on one to select.

Brightness parameter sets overall brightness - with an 18 W USBC supply powering fates, mine is OK at 128 (out of 256) brightness.

I used an eyedropper program to get RGB values from these palettes:
